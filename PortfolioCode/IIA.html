			<h1>Innovation in Action, Honey</h1>

		</section>
		<section class="introbody">
			<br>
			<p>Honey is a business idea that stemmed from my final project in my interaction design course that aimed to help women find better contraceptive methods for their personal health and lifestyle. I collaborated with four other students in the schools of public health and pharmacy to take this idea further and develop it through <a href = "http://innovationinaction.umich.edu/">Innovation in Action</a>. This 5-month competition includes workshops and resources that give students the tools and skills needed to form an innovative idea into a successful start-up. Each idea must be rooted in public health and aim to make a social impact. The competition culminates in a pitch to real entrepreneurs and investors in the local community. The Honey team was one of five finalists that were chosen to present in the final rounds.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Pitch Summary: Three million unplanned pregnancies occur annually. An unplanned pregnancy can lead to worry and derailment of womenâ€™s aspirations. More women are pursuing higher education and professional achievement and many do not know how to make reproductive choices that fit their lives and goals. With no open and positive resources to guide these choices, women are left turning to other women around them for answers or scouring the internet for a credible source. Honey is a community-focused web platform where women can learn and shop for their contraceptive needs. Through crowd-sourced reviews and a sex-positive online community, Honey users will be empowered to make the contraceptive choices that align best with her needs. With Honey, busy women no longer will have to worry about pharmacy hours or the shame of buying emergency contraception in-person. Honey users will have peace of mind with convenient and confidential home delivery of contraception that fits into their demanding lives.</p>
