	<div class="about">
		<p>I grew up in Michigan and went to University of Michigan for my bachelorâ€™s degree. I was unsure of my career path during undergrad, but I was interested in science and passionate about the connection between the environment and human health from travelling to South America and Canada for service and camping trips in high school. I completed all of the pre-med requirements and majored in Environment with the intention to go into integrative medicine. I thought that I wanted to help people feel informed and empowered in regards to their health through becoming a doctor. 
		<br><br>
		After I graduated, I was working in sports medicine research at the <a href = "https://www.sprivail.org/">Steadman Philippon Research Institute</a>. During this time, I learned about how evidence-based medicine and data science can impact healthcare and started to become interested in information science and health. One night, I was researching this and came across the health informatics program at Michigan. I decided to apply. As I was writing my application, I started to realize that I may be able to make a larger impact in helping to inform patients about their health through a career in health informatics as opposed to a career as a physician. 
		<br><br>
		During my first semester in the health informatics program, I took a class called interaction design that introduced me to user experience (UX) research and design. I was intrigued by the idea of designing for health. My father and brother are both architects, so I grew up with an appreciation and interest in design. The rapidly changing IT environment in the health industry offers unique and interesting challenges for design to tackle. Challenges that I had experience with from working, volunteering, and shadowing in clinical environments.  Through my graduate program and internship, I gained many opportunities to learn and practice UX design within the health field. 
		<br><br>
		After I graduate in May, I seek to find a position that will allow me to apply my clinical knowledge with my understanding of informatics and UX Design to tackle big challenges in health.
